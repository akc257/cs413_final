# CS413 Project 3 - Tiles

There is no real theme to this game other than the technical requirement that it should use
tiles and some sort of tile layout engine as part of the game. The tile map that you use must
be larger than the screen - this in turn implies that you do some kind of screen or camera 
management.
You should design your game for a play experience of roughly one to three minutes.
## Technical Objectives
Technical objectives describe the organizational or code-related features that are a
required part of your game and will be evaluated in the technical objective rubric for this
project.  In grading technical objectives, we will ask the question “How well does this
project provide evidence of the objective?”  For example, a single Git commit probably does
not represent outstanding “use of git”.  You should design your game with technical and
creative objectives in mind such that your project design supports the objectives and
learning outcomes associated with the project description.
* Use of tiles
* Use of spritesheets
* Use of scene graph and classes to organize “screens”
* Use of Git
## Creative Objectives
Creative objectives mirror the technical objectives but involve subjective creative features
of your project.
* Compelling and attractive design
* Interesting / fun
* Consistent palette / style
* Consistent branding / atmosphere
* Balance of difficulty

## What do I turn in?
In BBLearn you should turn in a report (entered with the BBLearn editor) with the
following format:
* Project 3 Tiles
* Astro
* http://dana.ucc.nau.edu/akc257/cs413/project_3
* https://github.com/akc257/CS413_Tiles
### What should Github Repo contain?
Your Github repository should contain all the code for your repository including any library
dependencies (which isn’t necessarily a great practice but it makes it easier for us to grade
and debug). The “index.html" entry point for your game should be in the topmost directory.  
You should also have a “thumb.png” file which is sized to 150 pixels wide (height may maintain the aspect ratio). Your index.html file should contain:
* The game canvas
* Instructions on how to play the game
* A Disqus embed code
The grading rubric, which is common for all projects, is posted in BBLearn.
