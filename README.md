# CS413 Project 4 - Final Project

The final project has fewer rules than previous projects and gives you the opportunity to
try out skills, techniques, and ideas you may not have explored in previous projects.  Your
project must be substantially more complex than previous projects.  This project has twice
the point value of the other projects.
You should design your game for a play experience of roughly two to five minutes.
## Technical Objectives
Technical objectives describe the organizational or code-related features that are a
required part of your game and will be evaluated in the technical objective rubric for this
project.  In grading technical objectives, we will ask the question “How well does this
project provide evidence of the objective?”  For example, a single Git commit probably does
not represent outstanding “use of git”.  You should design your game with technical and
creative objectives in mind such that your project design supports the objectives and
learning outcomes associated with the project description.
* Use of techniques described in the reading
* Use of graphics
* Use of sound
* Use of Git
## Creative Objectives
Creative objectives mirror the technical objectives but involve subjective creative features
of your project.
* Compelling and attractive design
* Interesting / fun
* Consistent palette / style
* Consistent branding / atmosphere
* Balance of difficulty

## What do I turn in?
In BBLearn you should turn in a report (entered with the BBLearn editor) with the
following format:
* Project 4 Final
* Astro
* http://dana.ucc.nau.edu/akc257/cs413/project_4
* https://github.com/akc257/cs413_final
### What should Github Repo contain?
Your Github repository should contain all the code for your repository including any library
dependencies (which isn’t necessarily a great practice but it makes it easier for us to grade
and debug). The “index.html" entry point for your game should be in the topmost directory.
You should also have a “thumb.png” file which is sized to 150 pixels wide (height may maintain the aspect ratio). Your index.html file should contain:
* The game canvas
* Instructions on how to play the game
* A Disqus embed code
The grading rubric, which is common for all projects, is posted in BBLearn.
